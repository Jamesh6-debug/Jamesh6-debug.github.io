        <p>This webpage is for CSCE 190</p>
        <div class ="about"><h2>About Me</h2><p>My overall goal is to become a software engineer with the ability to take on a multitude of 
jobs using the skills I learn both in college and on my own. I’ll manage my time and plan out 
how I’ll go about my days. Through persistence and determination, I’ll make this a reality. If 
all goes according to plan, I’ll have the freedom to either do freelance work or land a job of 
my dreams.</p>
<div class="skills"><h2>Skills</h2><p>I'd say I'm pretty persistent.</p></div>

        <p>The doors at South Quad are somewhat finnicky and can get stuck. Sometimes you'll just be tugging on the door for around 10 seconds until it opens. Other times, you'll likely just give up and try another. It's pretty inconvenient.</p>
