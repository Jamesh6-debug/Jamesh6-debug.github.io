        <p>This webpage is for CSCE 190</p>
        <div class ="about"><h2>About Me</h2><p>My overall goal is to become a software engineer with the ability to take on a multitude of 
jobs using the skills I learn both in college and on my own. I’ll manage my time and plan out 
how I’ll go about my days. Through persistence and determination, I’ll make this a reality. If 
all goes according to plan, I’ll have the freedom to either do freelance work or land a job of 
my dreams.</p>
<div class="skills"><h2>Skills</h2><p>I'd say I'm pretty persistent.</p></div>
